# Java_4

Java Feature 
-------------------------
Simple: Java is simple as it contains lots of Api/Libraries
Ex:    
     Arrays.sort(n);

Object oriented: Java is Object Oriented (oo) as it supports all the oo features like  Objects, Classes, abstaction, encapsulation , Inheritance and Polymorphism

Robust: Robust means Strong - In Jva We can develop robust applications Using Exception Handeling which avoids abnormal termination of application

Platform Independant: means  opration system independant

Interpreted - Java command is an interpreter  Diffrence between interpreter and compailer is Compailer means at a time Interpriter means line by line.

Portable--Language c/C++
size of int data type=> 2 byteon 32 -bit/4 bytes on 64 bits OS
Java --
size of int dat type => 4 byte on 32-bit/64 bit OS


secure: A pointer is a variable which catains address of another variable 
Jav is secure as Java Does not support Pointer as Pointers  violate Security 
Ex
Int n = 10;
int *p = &n; // addr of n variable


Multythreaded: - A thread is a light weight process under execution with in a process
- multithreading is used to increase the performance of application
- 
Dynamic- memory allocation for arrays , object is done during runtime(dynamics)
-java is Automatic garbage collection


Distributers
- Distribution application are used for the purpose of exchanging data from one application to another application

- 
--A java program can run on any Platform(OS)
--A Java Program Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA)
--A Jav Program is a collection of class

EX:
   X.java(Source Code)

   ClassA{
   void main(){.........}
   }
   ClassB{

   
   }


   To compile 
   >javac X.java
-create A.class,B.class
-these  .class files are Called as Byte code
-these Byte codes are platform independent
- to run a java program atleast one class should contain main() method
- main() is the entry point to run a java program.
- -We can run only .class files which contain main ()

- To Run
- java A - runs the program from A class main()
- Java B -runs the program from A
- Javax => Error - no class defination found
